## Current support
End-to-end user connection and login with chat support for up to 25 simultaneous users, each with custom profiles.

## Login information for testing purposes
Currently, I have it set up so that profiles can only be created on my end. If you would like to log in and test functionality:
- Username: test
- Password: 12345
